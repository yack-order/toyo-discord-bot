# toyo-discord-bot
Bot for the TOYO Discord with customized commands.

# TOYO Bot Slash Commands
The toyobot, as all bots in the TOYO discord are, is limited to the `#robot-mayhem` channel. 

## /yoto-playlist <url> <show>

### Description: 
Get info about a playlist (private to you).

### Parameters:
* url (requried): yoto.io url to fetch data from
* show: true/false; defaults to false; if true, the response will be displayed to all users. 

### Notes: 
* By default, the response will only be visible to the user to sent the command. Use `show: true` to overide this and publish the response to the whole channel. 
* All command executions that are visible to the whole channel will expose the full command, including the parameters. yoto.io URLs that are for physical cards or non-shared MYO playlists should **NOT** be shared publicly, ever. 

### Examples:
`/yoto-playlist url: https://yoto.io/2u1gx?g4K9YqFNigES=5qiiuZqxtx7hu`

## /yoto-store <url>

### Description: 
Get info from the **yoto store** 

### Parameters:
* url (required): yotoplay.com url for the card or card pack listing.

### Notes:
* This will also sometimes work for wayback urls from the Internet Archive.
* Geographicly limited store pages may be restircted and unable to parse properly. This is untested.

### Examples: 
`/yoto-store url:https://us.yotoplay.com/products/frog-and-toad-audio-collection`

# Development Notes
* Write the code in the `/src` folder. Helper functions can be included as their own `.js` files but will then need to be marked with `export` and then `import { name } from './file.js'` wherever they are going to be used. 
* `server.js` is the main bundle of code that is used by the server. This is what is hosted in cloudflare.
* **DEV** Use `npm ngrok` to host the code locally. 
    * If doing this, the [Discord Application](https://discord.com/developers/applications/1354448393304408195/information) will need to be updated for where it points. Get the ngrok url and paste it in the `Interactions Endpoint URL` field.
    * Note: I probably need to create a dev-bot on discord and a dev discord so this can be tested outside production. the issue is that things perform differently in dev versus prod because prod is run from cloudflare workers directly.
* **PROD** Use `npm run deploy` to push the updated code to Wrangler/cloudflare
* **SECRETS** Secrets/constants can be pushed into cloudflare 
    * push directly from the dev command line like this `npx wrangler secret put NAME_OF_VARIABLE`, or
    * use the webui at cloudflare to create Secrets
    * To Use: then import them into the code using `const token = process.env.NAME_OF_VARIABLE;` within the javascript file.
* ~~TODO: figure out how to do the wrangler deploy from github actions~~
* This comes from [the guide here](https://v13.discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/command-handling.html).
* [cloudflare guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/quickstarts/) to create the worker, then follow [This Guide](https://github.com/discord/cloudflare-sample-app) to set up a sample app. For the most part I just copied content out of the sample app into the new worker i created. Its janky, but it worked. shut up.

# Building New Commands
1. `src/commands.js` - Add a new command using the template. It needs a name for the **const** to use, the **name** value is what a user enters in the chat `/yoto-store-info parameters go here`, **description** is what pops up when the user is typing. Options can be used. 
    ```javascript
        export const GET_STORE_PAGE_COMMAND = {
        name: 'yoto-store-info',
        description: 'Get information about a listing from the Yoto store.',
        };
    ```
2. `register.js` - **Line 1** Update the import line to include the new command **constant**:
    ```javascript
            import { AWW_COMMAND, GET_STORE_PAGE_COMMAND } from './commands.js';
    ```
3. `register.js` - **Line 37** Add the new command **constant** into the PUT command body string. 
    ```javascript
        body: JSON.stringify([AWW_COMMAND, GET_STORE_PAGE_COMMAND]),
    ```
4. `server.js` - **Line 11** Add a new import line to include the new command **constant** and command **function**:
    ```javascript
        import { GET_STORE_PAGE_COMMAND, GET_STORE_PAGE_EXEC } from './commands.js';
    ```
5. `server.js` - Add a new command processor for the `router.post` function:
    ```javascript
        case GET_STORE_PAGE_COMMAND.name.toLowerCase():{
            return GET_STORE_PAGE_EXEC(request, env, interaction);
        }
    ```
6. `server.js` - Add a new `router.get` function call:
    ```javascript
        router.get('/yoto-store-page', (request, env) => {
            return YOTO_STORE_PAGE_EXEC(request, env, "webget");
        });
    ```
7. `command.js` (or some other helper file) - Write the code to process the actions inside the `YOTO_STORE_PAGE_EXEC` function created.
    ```javascript
        export function YOTO_STORE_PAGE_EXEC(request, env, interaction) {  
        return new JsonResponse({
            type: InteractionResponseType.CHANNEL_MESSAGE_WITH_SOURCE,
            data: {
                content: "Pong!",
            }
        })
        };
    ```
8. On the command line (in the working folder) run `npm run register` to register the commands with Discord
9. If possible to test, Test using ngrok `npm run ngrok`
10. Deploy directly to cloudflare (see above) `npm run publish`
11. Publish the code to GitHub

# Using the Google Sheets API (Public Sheet Method)

If your Google Sheet is set to **Anyone with the link can view**, you can access it without authentication using the Google Sheets API and an API key. This is suitable for read-only access to public data.

---

### 1. Make Your Google Sheet Public

- Open your Google Sheet.
- Click **Share**.
- Under "General access," select **Anyone with the link** and set to **Viewer**.

---

### 2. Get Your Spreadsheet ID

- The Spreadsheet ID is the long string in your sheet's URL:
  ```
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<SPREADSHEET_ID>/edit#gid=0
  ```

---

### 3. Get a Google API Key

- Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Create or select a project.
- Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
- Click **Create Credentials** > **API key**.
- Copy your API key.

---

### 4. Fetch Data from the Sheet

You can use a simple HTTP request to get data from your sheet.  
Example (for Sheet1, range A1:Z100):

```sh
curl "https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/<SPREADSHEET_ID>/values/Sheet1!A1:Z100?key=<YOUR_API_KEY>"
```

Or in JavaScript:

```javascript
const sheetId = "<SPREADSHEET_ID>";
const apiKey = "<YOUR_API_KEY>";
const range = "Sheet1!A1:Z100";
const url = `https://sheets.googleapis.com/v4/spreadsheets/${sheetId}/values/${encodeURIComponent(range)}?key=${apiKey}`;

fetch(url)
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data.values));
```

---

### 5. Store the Public Sheet URL in Your `.dev.vars`

```plaintext
ARCHIVE_SHEETS_DB_URL: "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<SPREADSHEET_ID>/edit?usp=sharing"
```

---

**Note:**  
- This method is **read-only** and exposes your data to anyone with the link.
- For private or write access, use a service account as described in the previous section.

# This junk below came from some copilot ideation and has not been implemented yet. 
The code it generated lives in a file called `copilot_draft_toyobot.js`. As any of it becomes usable it will be converted into commands and pushed into the `./toyobot/src` folder structure.

---

---

# Notes
1. Rate Limits:
    * Ensure your bot handles API rate limits gracefully to avoid being throttled by either Discord or Google.
2. Security:
    * Do not hardcode sensitive tokens (Discord bot token or Google credentials) in your code. Use environment variables or a secure configuration file.
3. Error Handling:
    * The bot includes basic error handling but can be expanded to cover specific issues like invalid ranges or insufficient permissions.
4. Permissions:
    * Ensure the Service Account used for the Google Sheets API has "Editor" permissions for the spreadsheet.
    * Ensure the Service Account used for the Google Sheets API has "Editor" permissions for the `links_from_discord` spreadsheet.
    * Ensure the Service Account has "Reader" access to the `Card_DB` spreadsheet.
    * Ensure the Google Sheets API service account has "Editor" access to the `points_fetch_log` spreadsheet.
5. Spreadsheet ID:
    * Replace the placeholder YOUR_DISCORD_USERS_SPREADSHEET_ID with the actual ID of your Google Sheet.
6. Customization:
    * You can extend the commands to include additional metadata, such as a description for the URL or a timestamp.
    * You can modify the headers array to match the actual column headers in your spreadsheet.

# How It Works
1. Command: `archive-application-status`
    * The spreadsheet query function uses the `message.author.id` (Discord user ID) to find matching data in the spreadsheet.
    * Assumes the spreadsheet has Discord user IDs in column `A` and application statuses in column `B`. Update the `range` and index logic if your structure is different.
    * Gracefully handles cases where the user ID does not exist in the spreadsheet or when the spreadsheet is empty.
    * The bot sends a read-only request to the specified range in the Google Spreadsheet.
    * The bot formats the retrieved data and sends it back to the Discord channel as a reply.
2. Command: `link-email`
    * When a user types `link-email user@example.com`, the bot stores the provided email and the user’s Discord ID in the `Discord_Users` spreadsheet.
    * Uses the `spreadsheets.values.append` method from the Google Sheets API to insert new rows into the sheet.
    * Ensures the provided email contains an "@" symbol to check for validity. You can add more complex validation logic if needed.
    * Stores the Discord user ID in column `A` and the email address in column `B` of the `Discord_Users` spreadsheet.
    * Replies to the Discord channel with success or error messages based on the outcome.
    * Handles errors such as invalid email input or issues connecting to the Google Sheets API.
3. Command: `submit-card`
    * Users can type `submit-card https://example.com` to submit a URL for storage in the `links_from_discord` spreadsheet.
    * Uses spreadsheets.values.append from the Google Sheets API to insert new rows into the sheet.
    * Stores the Discord user ID in column A and the submitted URL in column B of the `links_from_discord` spreadsheet.
    * Ensures the provided URL starts with "http" to confirm it's valid. You can extend this logic for more robust validation if needed.
    * Provides feedback to the user, confirming whether the URL was successfully submitted or if an error occurred.
    * Handles errors related to URL submission or connectivity issues with the Google Sheets API.
4. Command: `check-card`
    * Returns information about the card if the identifier is known.
    * Exact ID Match: Users can type `check-card hMkni ` to submit an identifier to search for.
        * If a 5-character identifier is provided, the bot performs an **exact, case-sensitive match** in column `A`.
        * Returns an error if multiple entries are found with the same ID. This is a data integrity problem that needs to be solved by an administrator.
    * Non-Case-Sensitive Title Search: Users can type `check-card Make Your Own Guide` to submit a title to search for.
        * If the search term is a string (not a 5-character ID), the bot performs a **non-case-sensitive match** in column `C`.
        * Provides a list of matching IDs if multiple results are found, prompting the user to search by ID for detailed information.
    * Ensures only one match is returned for ID-based searches.
    * Handles cases where no matches are found.
    * Returns data in the format of `header: data` for columns A, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, and R.
5. Command: `fetch-points`
    * When the user types `fetch-points`, the bot retrieves the message author's Discord ID and username.
    * Uses the Google Sheets API to search the spreadsheet for the Discord ID in column `A`.
    * Retrieves the points from column `K` (10th index in the array).
    * Formats the Mee6 command `/give-item member:discordID item:Yak Point amount:X` using the retrieved points.
    * Logs the execution (add logic to send the command to the bot in Discord if necessary).
    * Appends a log entry to the points_fetch_log spreadsheet, recording the username, Discord ID, and points awarded.
    * Handles cases where the Discord ID doesn't exist or points are invalid (not a number).
    * Spreadsheet Structures: Points Spreadsheet, Points Fetch Log
    * The Mee6 command must be executed in a Discord channel where Mee6 is active. You can use the Discord API to send the command to the appropriate channel programmatically.
    * Includes error handling for invalid Discord IDs, invalid points values, and connectivity issues with the Google Sheets API.
